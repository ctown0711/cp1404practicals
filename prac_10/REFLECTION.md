## Regarding the estimates that you did for practical tasks,how was your accuracy
## and did your accuracy improve during the course of the subject?

Regarding the accuracy for subjects that I felt confident on I was generally pretty accurate all the way through

However, for subjects I wasn't I tried to give myself a little more time than
usual and would often still see myself exceeding that estimate I set myself.

Over the course of the subject I'd say I improved slightly but it's mostly 
dependent on how well I understand the concept that we're studying for me.

## Regarding code reviews, what have you learned from both being reviewed and doing reviews?

Code reviews have helped me clean up my code a lot with smalls things as having an if else on the same line
or different ways to use .join methods etc when reading and reviewing others. In terms of people writing reviews
about my code, I've been given a few good ideas such as finding the max len of words using a list comprehension
which I didn't know was possible and couple more. Overall code reviews were a great idea and also got me used to
using Git and making pull requests etc.

## Regarding the practical tasks overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?

I think the practical tasks are really useful and were probably what really helped me to understand classes properly.
Following the lectures I was concerned about how I was going to fare using classes in the future but actually seeing
the programs, especially the walkthrough examples in the practicals I believe it helped me a lot more than some of the
lecture videos. The only thing I would maybe change is the kivydemos or the lectures to include the GUI functionality
of just removing and re-adding widgets to dynamically update the GUI. Unless it's already in the demos and I missed it.
