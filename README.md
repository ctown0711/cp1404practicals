# CP1404 Practicals

Practical work for IT@JCU CP1404

## About me

My name is Caleb Townsend, and I am a student at James Cook University.

- Using good naming conventions makes more readable code.
- Replacing literal strings, integers, etc. with constants makes code easier to understand and change.
- Copying the patterns e.g. for, while loop patterns makes mistakes less likely.
