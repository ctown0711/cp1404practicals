Practical work for IT@JCU CP1404

## About me

My name is Caleb Townsend, and I am a student at James Cook University.

Using good naming conventions makes more readable code.
Replacing literal strings, integers, etc. with constants makes code easier to understand and change.
Copying the patterns e.g. for, while loop patterns makes mistakes less likely.
